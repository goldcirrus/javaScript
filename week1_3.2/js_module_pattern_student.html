<h2>!JavaScript Module Pattern: hide parent function's variables</h2>

<p id="demo">Student variables name and id are private</p>

<script>
// In a library
//we can hide variable name, id with modle pattern. 
//the object returned from parent function:Student() has private variable name and id. 
//closures, parent function must be called to return a child object
function Student(initial_name, initial_id) {
    let name = initial_name;        //local and private hiden in parent function
    let id = initial_id;            //local and private hiden in parent function
    
	return {                        //returned child function constructs a new object contains property functions can access parent's private variables
        setName: function (new_name) { name = new_name; },  //public function in returned child function can access parent function's private variables
        getName: function () { return name; },               //public function in returned child function can access parent function's private variables
        setId: function (new_id) { id = new_id; },           //public function in returned child function can access parent function's private variables
        getId: function () { return id; }                    //public function in returned child function can access parent function's private variables
    }
}

// In an app
let name = prompt("Name: ");   //user input stored in variable:name
let id = prompt("Id: ");       //user input stored in variable:id

//Parent function: Student() called to create a Student object WITHOUT new keyword. works only because constructor Student return a child function
//literally, invoked parent function: Student(name,id); returns the child function here, which is a object has its property functions to access its parent function's private variables:name and id
let student = Student(name, id);  // Parent function Student(); called. Create a new Student object contains public property functions can access Parent Consturctor function's private variables:name and id

alert(student.getName() + ", " + student.getId());  // display the student's name and id
alert(student.name);  // accessible? no, it is undefined, parent function's variable name is private, can be accessed via returned object's property function
