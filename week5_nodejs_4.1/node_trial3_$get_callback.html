/*I/O jobs, such as file, serial, and communication operations, generally take a long time. 
$.get() is a system I/O function
Then, how user programs knows that the I/O jobs are completed? Answer is Non-blocking calls with callback functions. 
Obviously the answer is callback functions: 
When a system I/O function, e.g., $.get() is called, a callback function can be passed. 
The callback function is called when the I/O job($.get) is completed.

How does that work? The answer is the event-driven architecture.
The event-driven architecture is used not only for I/O jobs, but also for all other events, 
like HTML elements related events such as 'onclick', 'keyup', 'load', and so on. 
When I/O jobs are completed, related events are triggered.
The event-driven programming includes the registration of an event listener for an event on an object, 
where the event listener is a callback function that will be called when the event is triggered on the event.
