'~name' is assumed as the home HTML directory of the user 'name' is assumed, 
and '~name' should be expanded. For example, '/~tom' should be replaced by '/home/tom/public_html'. For the exact home directory, 
you may use the "tilde-expansion" module. 
After you install the module as 

$ npm install tilde-expansion 

in the current working directory,

var tilde = require("tilde-expansion");  // reference: tilde-expansion
tilde('~tom', function(expanded) {
    console.log(expanded);                //~tom
});
