5.1.2 Relative URLs

A relative URL (defined in [RFC1808]) doesn't contain any protocol or machine information. Its path generally refers to a resource on the same machine as the current document. 
Relative URLs may contain relative path components (".." means one level up in the hierarchy defined by the path), and may contain fragment identifiers.

Relative URLs are resolved to full URLs using a base URL. [RFC1808] defines the normative algorithm for this process.

As an example of relative URL resolution, 
assume we have the base URL "http://www.acme.com/support/intro.html". 

The relative URL in the following markup for a hypertext link:
  <A href="suppliers.html">Suppliers</A>
would expand to the full URL "http://www.acme.com/support/suppliers.html", while the relative URL in the following markup for an image

  <IMG src="../icons/logo.gif" alt="logo">
would expand to the full URL "http://www.acme.com/icons/logo.gif".
